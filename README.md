# Machine Learning 

This R was coded as an individual project for the Arificial Intelligence module during year 3. 


## Learning outcomes for the project 

* LO1: Demonstrate a good grasp of concepts in unspuervised and supervised learning, neural networks, vision and image analysis, neural networks, expert systems, deep learning and probabilistic methods.
* LO2: Competently assess, employ, and implement the key AI techniques.
* LO3: Select appropriate AI tools and techniques and show how they can be effectively applied to real-world problem solving.
